A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

Following are the criteria for checking the password:

At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

Example

If the following passwords are given as input to the program:

ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:

ABd1234@1

#You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, score) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and score are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
"""
1: Sort based on name
2: Then sort based on age
3: Then sort by score
